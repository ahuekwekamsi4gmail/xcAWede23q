 Albert Einstein (1879-1955)
Albert Einstein is one of the most famous scientists in the world. He used to be an eccentric person who was perhaps the only scientist in the world who has become such a household name.
His theories of relativity, gravitation and his understanding of molecules have defined new approaches in science. Einstein’s contribution through the discovery of the photoelectric effect earned him a Nobel Prize in 1921. Moreover, his work opened doors for newer things to be discovered.

2. Isaac Newton (1642-1727)
Isaac Newton is attributed for the establishment of a lot of basic principles of science. He also laid the foundation for understanding more advanced concepts. He put forth the knowledge of how planets stay in orbit and move through space. 
Isaac explained how projectiles traveled through the air on earth and thus put forward the theory of gravitational force. Besides this, he has made immense contributions to light, color, and refined electric telescopes, which are still in use and known by his name.

3 Marie Curie (1867-1964)
Great scientists go to great heights to be successful in their discoveries. Marie Curie, along with her husband Pierre, was a pioneer in researching radioactive elements such as uranium. Her research also led to the discovery of a new radioactive element, which she named polonium. Moreover, she discovered another element called radium, which helped take the study of radioactive elements forward. 
Along with this, she was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and won the award again. She helped set up the first radiology center during World War I and is the world’s first medical physicist. Unfortunately, her constant exposure to radioactive elements led to anemia and, ultimately, her demise.

4. Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) 
Nikola Tesla was one of the greatest minds of his time. Dubbed the wizard of the industrial revolution, his contribution to the electrification of life is crucial to us now.
The life that we live now – with a steady supply of electricity – is because of the efforts of Nikola Tesla. He is most famous for his invention of the first alternating current, also known as AC. He also invented a high voltage transmitter known as Tesla Coil, which is used by the telecom industry to transmit wireless power.

#5 Charles Darwin (1809-1882)
 Darwin is known as one of the world’s top scientists. He was a geologist, a naturalist, and a biologist.
Charles Darwin is regarded as one of the most crucial scientists who have theorized evolution and put forward an understanding of different species in the world.

#6 Ada Lovelace (1815-1852)
Ada Lovelace was a mathematician who contributed one of the most useful innovations in the world. She is the first person to devise the language of computer programming. She did this a century before the first computer in the world was invented!
Ada also devised an analytical engine where users could punch in mathematical orders through a card, and the machine would solve the problem. Her instructions for this machine are considered the world’s first computer program.

#7 Rosalind Franklin (1920-1958) 
Rosalind Franklin has played an instrumental role in explaining the double helix structure of the DNA, which has pushed medical science to new boundaries. She discovered the density of DNA and also established the molecule that existed in a helical conformation.
However, in 1962, when Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins won the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the DNA’s helix structure, Franklin was snubbed. That’s not to say that great innovation doesn’t transcend time, seeing that she is much cherished and respected by the scientific community today.
